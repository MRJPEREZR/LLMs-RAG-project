The final competition (“FIFA World Cup 26”) is scheduled to be played from
11 June to 19 July 2026.
1.6
Any rights associated with the FIFA World Cup 26 that are not granted by
these Regulations for the FIFA World Cup 26™ (“Regulations”) and/or further
regulations, guidelines and decisions as set forth in these Regulations and/or
specific agreements to a Participating Member Association in the preliminary or
final competition, or to a confederation, shall remain with and/or belong to FIFA.
1.7
These Regulations govern the rights, duties and responsibilities of all
member associations taking part in the FIFA World Cup 26 (“Regulations”).
The Regulations and all directives, decisions, guidelines and circulars issued
by FIFA in connection with the FIFA World Cup 26 are binding on all parties
participating and involved in the preparation, organisation and hosting of
the FIFA World Cup 26.
1.8
The FIFA Statutes and all FIFA regulations in force shall apply to and be binding
on all parties participating and involved in the preparation, organisation and
hosting of the FIFA World Cup 26. Any reference in these Regulations to the
FIFA Statutes and regulations refers to the FIFA Statutes and regulations valid
at the time of application.
1.9
Other rules and/or decisions that are directly binding on FIFA (e.g. due to FIFA
being a signatory to the World Anti‑Doping Code) may apply to the subject
matter of these Regulations. Any such rules and/or decisions implemented by
FIFA shall take precedence over these Regulations in the event of any conflict
and shall be complied with by all parties participating and involved in the
preparation, organisation and hosting of the FIFA World Cup 26™.
Article 2: PRELIMINARY COMPETITION
2.1
The preliminary competition shall be organised by FIFA in collaboration with
the confederations. The confederations have established a competition format,
which received the required approval from FIFA.
2.2
On entering the preliminary competition, each member association:
a) acknowledges and agrees that all administrative matters related to the

in compliance with the regulations submitted, and FIFA will only intervene
if a confederation requests FIFA’s assistance in those matters; and
b) undertakes to observe the principles of fair play.
2.3
The FIFA World Cup 26™ Play‑Off Tournament (“Play‑Off Tournament”) is
considered to be part of the preliminary competition. It is scheduled to be

Tournament are published by FIFA.
2.4
In the event that any of the confederations’ preliminary competitions are not held
or completed in a manner that determines which member association(s) qualify
for the final competition (due to cancellation, postponement, abandonment
or otherwise), FIFA shall decide, after consultation with the applicable
confederation, the member association(s) based within the territorial region
of the confederation as the participating member association(s).
The confederation shall base its proposal strictly on the sporting merits of the
member association(s) and shall provide a written report to FIFA explaining
the reasons for proposing the member association(s) when seeking FIFA’s
approval. In the event that FIFA does not approve the confederation’s proposed
member association(s), the confederation shall propose an alternative member
association(s) for FIFA’s approval.

the FIFA World Cup 26.

Article 5: PARTICIPATING MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS

in consideration of the relevant FIFA rules or regulations.
5.3
In addition, each Participating Member Association shall be responsible for:
a) the conduct of its Delegation Members;
b) paying for incidental costs and expenses incurred by its Delegation Members
and any other persons carrying out duties on its behalf during the course of
their stay in the host countries;

5.4
All Participating Member Associations shall confirm their participation in
the FIFA World Cup 26 by submitting the entry form and any other required
documentation as communicated by FIFA via the corresponding circular(s),
duly signed by the deadline(s) set by FIFA. The timely submission to FIFA of
any such documents is of the essence. If a Participating Member Association
fails to adhere to the time limits and/or fails to meet the formal requirements
for submitting the necessary documents, the FIFA organising body shall pass
a decision.
5.5
All Participating Member Associations shall indemnify, defend and hold FIFA,
each Local FIFA Subsidiary, and all of their officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents and all other auxiliary persons free and harmless
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, fines and expenses (including reasonable legal expenses)
of whatsoever kind or nature resulting from, arising out of, or attributable
to, any non‑compliance with these Regulations by the Participating Member
Associations, their Delegation Members, their affiliates and any third parties
contracted to the Participating Member Associations.
Article 6: WITHDRAWAL, UNPLAYED MATCHES,
ABANDONED MATCHES AND REPLACEMENT
6.1
All Participating Member Associations undertake to play all of their matches
until eliminated from the FIFA World Cup 26.
6.2
Any Participating Member Association that withdraws from the FIFA World
Cup 26 no later than 30 days before the first match of the final competition
shall be fined at least CHF 250,000 by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.
Any Participating Member Association that withdraws from the FIFA World
Cup 26 fewer than 30 days before the first match of the final competition shall
be fined at least CHF 500,000 by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.
Participating Member Associations that withdraw from the FIFA World Cup 26
at any time will be required to reimburse the team preparation money as well
as any other tournament‑related contribution payments that they received
from FIFA.
If any Participating Member Association is not admitted to, is excluded from
or withdraws from the FIFA World Cup 26 once the tournament has started,
the FIFA Disciplinary Committee may impose additional disciplinary measures.
These may take into account, in particular, the timing of the withdrawal or
exclusion, the severity of the rule breach leading to non‑admission or exclusion,
possible mitigating factors as well as any other relevant circumstances.
Disciplinary sanctions may include the expulsion of the Participating Member
Association concerned from subsequent FIFA competitions and/or the
replacement of the Participating Member Association with another member
association. The FIFA Council or the relevant committee may decide, in particular,
to replace the member association in question with another association.
6.3
Any match which is not played or which is abandoned – except in cases of
force majeure recognised by FIFA – may lead to the imposition of disciplinary
measures against the relevant Participating Member Association(s) by the
FIFA Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
6.4
Any Participating Member Association that withdraws from the FIFA World
Cup 26 once the tournament has started or whose behaviour is liable for a
match not being played or being abandoned may be ordered by the FIFA Council
or the relevant committee to reimburse FIFA, the Local FIFA Subsidiary or any
other Participating Member Association for any expenses incurred as a result
of its behaviour. In such cases, the association concerned may also be ordered
by FIFA to pay compensation for any damages incurred by FIFA, the Local FIFA
Subsidiary or any other Participating Member Association. The association in
14
question shall also forfeit any claim to financial remuneration from FIFA or
the Local FIFA Subsidiary.
6.5
If a Participating Member Association withdraws or a match cannot be played
or is abandoned as a result of force majeure, the authorised FIFA organising
body (including the Tournament Operation Centre) shall decide on the matter
at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed necessary.
6.6
Further to the above provision, in the case of a match being abandoned as a
result of force majeure after it has already kicked off, the following principles
shall apply:
a) The match shall recommence at the minute at which play was interrupted
rather than being replayed in full, and with the same scoreline. The match
shall recommence where play was stopped when the match was interrupted
(e.g. with a free kick, throw‑in, goal kick, corner kick, penalty kick, etc.). If the
match was abandoned while the ball was still in play, it shall restart with a
dropped ball from the position of the ball when play was stopped.
b)The match shall recommence with the same players on the pitch and substitutes
available as when the match was abandoned.
c) No additional substitutes may be added to the list of players on the start list.
d) The teams can make only the number of substitutions to which they were still
entitled when the match was abandoned.
e) Players sent off during the abandoned match cannot be replaced.
f) Any disciplinary measures imposed before the match was abandoned will be
dealt with in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
g) The kick‑off time, date, location and any other matter shall be decided by FIFA.
6.7
If any Participating Member Association withdraws and/or is excluded from
the FIFA World Cup 26, FIFA shall decide on the matter at its sole discretion
and take whatever action is deemed necessary. FIFA may decide to replace
the Participating Member Association in question with another association.
6.8
If a Participating Member Association withdraws and/or is disqualified prior
to the end of the group stage, the results of all of its matches will be declared
null and void.
6.9
FIFA has the right to cancel, reschedule or relocate one or more matches (or the
entire FIFA World Cup 26) for any reason at its sole discretion, including as a
result of force majeure or due to health, safety or security concerns.

Article 7: DISCIPLINARY MATTERS
7.1
Disciplinary infringements are dealt with in compliance with the FIFA Disciplinary
Code in force as well as with all relevant circulars and directives, with which
the Participating Member Associations and Delegation Members undertake
to comply.
7.2
FIFA may introduce new disciplinary rules and measures for the duration of
the FIFA World Cup 26. Such rules shall be communicated to the Participating
Member Associations before the first match of the final competition at the latest.
7.3
Any violations of these Regulations or any other FIFA regulations, circulars,
guidelines, directives and/or decisions that do not come under the jurisdiction
of another FIFA body shall be dealt with by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee
in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
Article 8: DISPUTE RESOLUTION
8.1
All disputes in connection with the FIFA World Cup 26 shall be promptly settled
by negotiation (with the exception of those falling under art. 7 above).
8.2
As provided for in the FIFA Statutes, Participating Member Associations and
their Delegation Members may not take disputes to an ordinary court of law
but to the exclusive jurisdiction of FIFA.
8.3
The Participating Member Associations and all Delegation Members
acknowledge and accept that, once all internal channels have been exhausted
at FIFA, their sole legal recourse shall be to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, as provided for in the FIFA Statutes,
and unless excluded by the FIFA Statutes or applicable FIFA regulations.
Any such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the CAS Code of
Sports‑related Arbitration.
Article 9:PROTESTS
9.1
For the purpose of these Regulations, protests are objections of any kind
related to events or matters that have a direct effect on matches, including
but not limited to the state of and markings on the pitch, accessory match
equipment, eligibility of players, stadium installations and footballs.
9.2
Unless otherwise stipulated in this article, protests shall be submitted in
writing to the FIFA Match Director within two hours of the match in question,
as well as via the FIFA Legal Portal at legalportal.fifa.com (cf. art. 18 par. 1 of
the FIFA Disciplinary Code) within 24 hours of the end of the match, otherwise
they shall be disregarded.
9.3
Protests regarding the eligibility of players nominated for matches shall be
submitted via the FIFA Legal Portal at legalportal.fifa.com no later than five
days before the first match of the final competition and shall be dealt with by
the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.
9.4
Protests regarding the state of the pitch, its surroundings, markings or
accessory items (e.g. goals, flag posts or footballs) shall be made in writing
to the referee before the start of the match by the head of delegation of the
team lodging the protest. If the pitch’s playing surface becomes unplayable
during a match, the captain of the protesting team shall immediately lodge a
protest with the referee in the presence of the captain of the opposing team.
The protests shall be confirmed in writing to the FIFA Match Director by the
head of the team delegation no later than two hours after the match.
9.5
Protests against any incidents that occur during the course of a match shall
be made to the referee by the team captain immediately after the disputed
incident and before play has resumed, in the presence of the captain of the
opposing team. The protest shall be confirmed in writing to the FIFA Match
Director by the head of delegation no later than two hours after the match.
9.6
No protests may be made about the referee’s decisions regarding facts
connected with play. Such decisions are final and not subject to appeal, unless
otherwise stipulated in the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
9.7
If an unfounded or irresponsible protest is lodged, the FIFA Disciplinary
Committee may impose disciplinary measures against the Participating
Member Association concerned.
9.8
If any of the formal conditions of a protest as set out in these Regulations
(and in the FIFA Disciplinary Code, where applicable) are not met, such protest
shall be disregarded by the competent body. Once the final match of the
FIFA World Cup 26 has ended, any protests described in this article shall be
disregarded. Notwithstanding the above, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee
remains competent to prosecute any disciplinary infringement ex officio, as
established in the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
9.9
FIFA shall pass decisions on any protests lodged, subject to the exceptions
stipulated in these Regulations, the FIFA Statutes or any other FIFA regulations.
18
Article 10: YELLOW AND RED CARDS
10.1 The referee has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the
field of play for the pre‑match inspection until leaving the field of play after
the match ends (including penalties (penalty shoot‑out)). If, before entering
the field of play at the start of the match, a player or team official commits
a sending‑off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent the player or
team official from taking part in the match (see Laws of the Game, Law 12.3,
or any relevant amendment); the referee will report any other misconduct.
10.2 Single yellow cards and pending suspensions as a consequence of cautions
in different matches in the preliminary competition are not carried over to
the final competition. Pending match suspensions imposed as a result of a
red card in matches in the preliminary competition are carried over to the
final competition.
10.3 Single yellow cards in the final competition will be cancelled after the
quarter‑finals.
10.4 If a player or team official receives two cautions during two different matches,
they will automatically be suspended from their team’s subsequent match.
10.5 If a player or team official is sent off as a result of a direct or indirect red card
(second caution), they will automatically be suspended from their team’s
subsequent match. In addition, further sanctions may be imposed.
10.6 Any suspension that cannot be served during the FIFA World Cup 26 will be
carried over to the representative team’s next official match in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
10.7 Further details on rules and on the management of suspensions and expulsions
will be confirmed via circular letter.

Article 11: NUMBER OF TEAMS
11.1 The FIFA Council fixed the number of teams taking part in the FIFA World
Cup 26 at 48, namely the host member associations’ representative teams of
Canada, Mexico and the USA, and the 45 other teams that qualify from the
preliminary competition.
11.2 FIFA shall form groups for the final competition by seeding and drawing lots
whilst taking sporting and geographical factors into consideration, as far as
possible. Further details will be communicated by circular letter.
11.3 The decisions of FIFA on the group formation and the duration of the final
competition are final. In the event of any withdrawals or exclusions, FIFA shall
decide on the matter at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed
necessary.
11.4 On 9 May 2017, the FIFA Council decided to allocate the following number of
slots to the confederations for the FIFA World Cup 26:

The above slot allocation includes 46 direct slots as well as two slots to be
decided in a centralised Play‑Off Tournament featuring six teams. The following
Play‑Off Tournament competition format was approved by the FIFA Council
on 9 May 2017:
1. One team per confederation (AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC) with the exception
of UEFA, plus two teams from the confederation of the host countries (Concacaf).
2. Two teams to be seeded based on the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World Ranking.
The two seeded teams will play for a FIFA World Cup 26 slot against the winners
of the first two play‑off matches involving the four unseeded teams.
On 14 February 2023, the FIFA Council approved the hosts of the FIFA World
Cup 26, namely Canada, Mexico and the USA, to qualify automatically for the
final competition, with their slots therefore being deducted from the overall
allocation of six assigned to Concacaf.
Article 12: GROUP AND KNOCKOUT STAGES
12.1 The format of the final competition consists of a group stage, followed by the
knockout stages with a round of 32, a round of 16, quarter‑finals, semi‑finals,
the match for third place and the final.
12.2 The 48 teams taking part in the final competition will be divided into 12 groups
of four teams.
12.3 FIFA will seed the teams for the Final Draw for the FIFA World Cup 26™ in
accordance with the teams’ ranking within the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World
Ranking, as established in the draw procedures. FIFA will divide the teams into
groups by seeding and drawing lots in public, taking into account geographical
and sporting considerations.
As the host countries, Canada, Mexico and the USA will be assigned to the
following positions: A1 for Mexico, B1 for Canada and D1 for the USA, as
per the match schedule released on 4 February 2024 and as applied in the
draw procedures.
The teams in the 12 groups will be designated as follows:

Article 13: EQUAL POINTS AND QUALIFICATION FOR
KNOCKOUT STAGES
If two or more teams in the same group are equal on points after the completion
of the group stage, the following criteria, in the order below, shall be applied to
determine the ranking:
Step 1:
a) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams
concerned;
b) superior goal difference resulting from the group matches between the
teams concerned;
c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams
concerned.
Step 2:
If, after having applied criteria a) to c) above, teams still have an equal ranking, and
in order to determine their final rankings, criteria a) to c) above are applied to the
matches between the remaining teams only. If no decision can be made through
this procedure, criteria d) to f) below shall apply as follows to the two or more teams
still equal on points:
d) superior goal difference in all group matches;
e) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches;
f) highest team conduct score (players and team officials) relating to the number
of yellow and red cards obtained:
-
yellow card:




minus 1 point
-
indirect red card (as a result of two yellow cards):
minus 3 points
-
direct red card:



minus 4 points
-
yellow card and direct red card:


minus 5 points
Only one of the above deductions shall be applied to a player or team official in a
single match. The team with the highest number of points shall be ranked highest.
With respect to the second step, all affected teams will be ranked by applying the
criteria d) to f) in order. If one team qualifies for a higher or lower ranking pursuant
to one criterion, but it is not possible to rank all teams on the basis of the same
criterion, the remaining two or three teams will be ranked pursuant to the next
criterion, and so on. In any case, the second step of the ranking does not restart
for the two or three teams remaining after application of a criterion.
Step 3:
If no decision can be made through the procedures of step 1 and 2, the following
shall apply:
g) the two or more teams still equal on points shall be ranked according to the
most recent published edition of the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World Ranking;
h) the two or more teams still equal on points shall be ranked according to the
published edition of the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World Ranking immediately
preceding the most recent published edition continually until a decision can
be made.
The eight best‑ranked teams among those finishing third (third‑placed teams
from 1 to 8)
The eight best teams among those ranked third will be determined as follows:
a) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;
b) goal difference resulting from all group matches;
c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches;
d) highest team conduct score (players and team officials) relating to the number
of yellow and red cards obtained in all group matches and calculated as per
article 13 paragraph 1, step 2;
e) the two or more teams still equal on points shall be ranked according to the
most recent published edition of the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World Ranking;
f) the two or more teams still equal on points shall be ranked according to the
published edition of the FIFA/Coca‑Cola Men’s World Ranking immediately
preceding the most recent published edition continually until a decision can
be made.

extra time shall be played. Extra time shall consist of two 15‑minute periods,
with an interval of five minutes at the end of normal playing time, but not
between the two periods of extra time. The players shall remain on the pitch
during both of these intervals.
14.2 If the score is still level at the end of extra time, penalties (penalty shoot-out)
shall be taken to determine the winner, in accordance with the procedure
specified in the Laws of the Game.
14.3 Before the start of a penalty shoot‑out to determine the outcome of a match:
a) unless there are other considerations (e.g. ground conditions, safety, etc.),
the referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken,
which may only be changed for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface
becomes unusable; and
b) the referee tosses a coin again, and the team that wins the toss decides
whether to take the first or second kick.

26.1 FIFA shall issue each player and team official included on the final release
list with an official accreditation bearing a photograph. Each Participating
Member Association agrees to fully comply, and to ensure that all members
of its delegation, including players, coaches, managers, officials and
representatives also comply, with the FIFA Accreditation Terms and Conditions.
Each Participating Member Association will receive accreditations in accordance
with the final release list. Any additional accreditations may be requested from
FIFA Team Services in accordance with the official procedure prior to the final
competition. For the sake of clarity, FIFA will only cover the costs of up to a
maximum of 50 Delegation Members, as stipulated in the financial provisions
of these Regulations.
26.2 FIFA reserves the right to revoke the accreditation of any official or player due
to the misconduct of the individual concerned.
26.3 The Participating Member Associations shall ensure that all accreditation data
required by FIFA is submitted by the deadline stipulated by FIFA. Further details

26.4 Players and team officials shall wear their accreditation provided by FIFA
when entering hotels, stadiums and training sites. Only players in possession
of valid accreditation may play in the FIFA World Cup 26. Players shall wear
their accreditation at all times in the team hotels. Team officials must wear
their accreditation at all times, including during the match on the team bench.
Article 27: TEAM SAFEGUARDING/WELFARE OFFICER
Each Participating Member Association shall appoint a designated Team Safeguarding/
Welfare Officer to act as a focal point for all matters related to the safeguarding
and well‑being of the players and team delegation. This role does not have to be
exclusive and can be assigned to a team medical doctor or other trained member of
the accredited team delegation. It is a mandatory requirement that the designated
Team Safeguarding/Welfare Officer complete the FIFA Guardians Safeguarding
Essentials: Open Learners online course (https://safeguardinginfootball.fifa.com/
global‑football‑community‑learners/) and submit the certificate of completion
to FIFA. In addition, FIFA recommends that all members of the team delegation
accompanying the players complete the course. The role of the Team Safeguarding/
Welfare Officer is to:
a) act as the first point of contact and lead for all safeguarding matters within
the team delegation during the FIFA World Cup 26;
42
b) liaise with the FIFA Event Safeguarding Manager for the sharing of materials
with the delegation and for training session visits, and attend the Team
Safeguarding/Welfare Officer Workshop;
c) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the players’ and Delegation Members’
mental and physical well‑being is prioritised;
d) liaise with the tournament Safeguarding Manager and the FIFA Event
Safeguarding Manager should a concern or an allegation of harassment or
abuse (be it psychological, physical or sexual, or neglect) arise;
e) be aware (and make sure that all members of the team delegation are aware)
of the Safeguarding and Anti‑Discrimination Code of Conduct, with which
all accreditation holders, including the players, are required to comply; and

Article 28: KIT AND COLOURS APPROVAL
28.1 The FIFA Equipment Regulations and the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations
in force apply to all matches of the final competition, unless specified otherwise
in these Regulations. To the extent that these Regulations are inconsistent with
any aspect of the FIFA Equipment Regulations, the FIFA Equipment Regulations
shall take precedence.
The display of political, religious, or personal messages or slogans of any nature
in any language or form by players and team officials on their playing, team
kits or other clothing considered as outerwear and formal attire, before and
after playing, and equipment (including kit bags, beverage containers, medical
bags, etc.) or body is prohibited. The similar display of commercial messages
and slogans of any nature in any language or form by players and officials is
not allowed for the duration of their time at any official activity organised by
FIFA (including official matches and training sessions, as well as during official
press conferences and mixed‑zone activities).
28.2 Each team shall inform FIFA of a minimum of two different and contrasting
(one predominantly dark and one predominantly light) colours for each of its
first‑choice and alternative team kits (shirt, shorts and socks). In addition, each
team shall select a minimum of three contrasting colours for the goalkeepers.
These three goalkeeper kits must be different and contrasting from each
other as well as from the first‑choice and alternative team playing kits.
This information shall be submitted online via the team colour form by the
stipulated deadline. Only these colours, once reviewed and approved by FIFA
as stated in article 28 paragraph 3 below, may be worn during matches.
28.3 The Participating Member Associations shall send to FIFA for approval a sample
of all items of the full first‑choice and alternative team playing kits (shirt,
shorts, socks, all three goalkeeper’s kits, caps, wristbands and headbands, etc.)
intended for use during the final competition. In addition, FIFA shall organise a
kit‑day session prior to the final competition; should it do so, the date shall be
confirmed by circular letter or other official communication. Representatives of
all Participating Member Associations shall attend. All equipment (kits, bags,
medical equipment, etc.) that could be on display in the stadium, the training
sites and the hotels, or during transfers to, from or within the three host
countries, shall be approved by FIFA.
FIFA shall issue a written team equipment inspection report approving or
rejecting the items. Should any article of the team kit or any part thereof
not be in accordance with the FIFA Equipment Regulations and/or the FIFA
Media and Marketing Regulations, the Participating Member Association will
be obliged to change it accordingly and resubmit the corrected items within
the timeline set in the written team equipment inspection report. Any such
decisions are not subject to appeal.
28.4 All equipment (kits, bags, medical equipment, etc.) that could be on display
in the stadiums, the training sites and the hotels, or during transfers to, from
or within the three host countries, shall be re‑checked and approved by FIFA
during the Team Arrival Meeting for the FIFA World Cup 26.
28.5 From the moment that their teams first arrive in any of the three host countries,
and at the latest five days before the opening match until the end of the final
competition, Participating Member Associations may not display (including
on any clothing) any third‑party commercial identification or branding in any
final competition stadiums or training sites, or in connection with any official
media activities, other than:
a) on kit used at unofficial training sessions;
b) in the indoor press conference facility at their official training site (or other
press conference location approved by FIFA), but only when used for unofficial
events/activities; or
c) manufacturer’s identifications on kit, in accordance with the FIFA Equipment
Regulations.
More details may be provided in the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations.
28.6 The approval that has been granted by FIFA on each item is based on all
the information made available and provided to FIFA during the equipment
inspection and approval process. Any approval by FIFA is specific only to the
sample items submitted and reviewed by FIFA. It does not apply to any team kit,
uniform, material or other equipment that is not identical in all specifications
to the sample submitted and declared to FIFA.
For the avoidance of doubt, changing the context of the design, text, images,
associated messages or any other material in which the item is intended to be
used constitutes a change to the approved use of such item. If the approved
item is used in any manner conflicting with the applicable FIFA requirements
and regulations, FIFA shall have the right to, at any time, withdraw its approval
and the item shall not be used, as well as to open disciplinary proceedings
against the relevant Participating Member Association. Such cases shall be
processed in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.

Article 29: NUMBERS AND NAMES
29.1 Only the numbers 1 to 26 may be allocated to the players, with number 1
being reserved exclusively for one of the goalkeepers. These numbers shall be
displayed at chest height on the front of the shirt, on the front of the shorts
and on the back of the shirts according to the FIFA Equipment Regulations. The
numbers shall correspond to the numbers indicated on the final release list.
29.2 During the final competition, for any goalkeeper replacement, the incoming
goalkeeper shall be assigned the next possible shirt number not being used
yet, e.g. 27.
29.3 The player’s last name or popular (or abbreviation) name shall be affixed above
the number on the back of the shirt and shall be clearly legible in accordance
with the FIFA Equipment Regulations. The name on the shirt shall bear a strong
resemblance to the player’s popular name as indicated on the final release
list and in any other official FIFA documentation. In the event of two or more
players having the same name on the back of the shirt, further letter(s) or
initial(s) shall be added until a clear distinction can be made between the players
concerned. In case of doubt, FIFA shall have the final decision regarding the
name that appears on the shirt.
29.4 Each team shall supply a set of goalkeeper shirts without names or numbers
for the FIFA World Cup 26. These shirts will only be used in those special
circumstances in which an outfield player must take the position of goalkeeper
during a match. This extra set of goalkeeper shirts shall be provided in the
same three colours as the regular goalkeeper shirts.
Article 30: MATCH COLOURS DESIGNATION
30.1 No later than one month before the start of the final competition, FIFA will
inform the teams of the colours that they shall wear for each match of the
group stage. As far as is possible, FIFA’s preference is for each team to wear
its first‑choice colours as declared on the team colour form. If the two teams’
colours and the match officials’ colour might cause confusion, the following
principles shall be applied by FIFA to allocate the match colours:
a) Order of priority from 1 to 5:
1. Team A playing kit
2. Team B playing kit
3. Team A goalkeeper kit
4. Team B goalkeeper kit
5. Match officials’ (referees’) kit
If the above order of priority does not produce a clear colour contrast of the
kits (having considered the respective first‑choice playing kit and alternative
playing kit colour options), the allocation shall continue step by step in reverse
order (team B colours first, followed by team A colours and/or reversal of
team A and team B assignment, if necessary) until an acceptable colour
contrast is confirmed.
b) If necessary, one or both teams may have to wear a combination of their
first‑choice and alternative playing or goalkeeper kits, or each team may
have to play in its alternative colours, irrespective of its team A or team B
status. FIFA will endeavour to ensure that each team wears its first‑choice
team playing kit at least once during the group stage. In principle, FIFA shall
also consider the option of dark‑kit and light‑kit colour‑contrast assignments
in the interests of accommodating individuals with a colour vision deficiency
whenever reasonably practicable.
30.2 FIFA shall confirm the playing colours to the Participating Member Associations
before the start of each match. The colours shall be reviewed during the Match
Coordination Meeting by the FIFA Match Director. The colours assignment
decided by FIFA is final.
30.3 The first‑choice and alternative team playing kits and all goalkeeper kits
(including the goalkeeper shirts without names and numbers) shall be taken
to every match.
48
Article 31: OTHER EQUIPMENT
31.1 FIFA will supply a sufficient number of players’ sleeve badges with the official
competition logo of the FIFA World Cup 26, which shall be affixed on the
right‑hand sleeve of each shirt. A different FIFA campaign logo may be affixed
on the left‑hand sleeve. FIFA will communicate to the Participating Member
Associations the instructions for use of the players’ sleeve badges.
31.2 FIFA will provide each participating team with a set of equipment upon arrival
in one of the three host countries (e.g. drinks bottles, drinks coolers, medical
bags, etc.). This equipment shall be used at the stadiums and official training
sessions, to the exclusion of any other similar items, other than as detailed
in the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations.
31.3 For the FIFA World Cup 26, the captain of each team shall wear the captain’s
armband as issued by FIFA. If FIFA provides a choice of captain’s armband,
the captain should wear the one that contrasts most clearly with the sleeve
on which it is worn. FIFA shall have the right to, at any time, open disciplinary
proceedings against the relevant Participating Member Association for any
instances of non‑compliance. Such cases shall be processed in accordance
with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.
31.4 The footballs used in the FIFA World Cup 26 shall be selected and exclusively
supplied by FIFA. Each team will receive training balls from FIFA prior to the
final competition after the conclusion of the preliminary competition, and
after all teams have successfully submitted the required team entry details.
Training balls will also be provided to the participating teams upon arrival in
one of the three host countries. Only these balls provided by FIFA may be used
for training and warm‑up sessions at the official stadiums and training sites.
31.5 Only warm‑up bibs provided by FIFA may be used during official training
sessions and at the stadium in the pre‑match warm‑up, on the team benches,
and for the warm‑up of substitute players during matches.
31.6 Participating teams are allowed to use their own wearable tracking system
as long as the system has been tested and certified according to the Laws of
the Game, registered with FIFA by the Participating Member Association for
use in the final competition and otherwise complies with the FIFA Equipment
Regulations, the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations and any other applicable
FIFA regulations.

Article 32: START LIST
32.1 The electronic start list system will be available and accessible eight hours
prior to the kick‑off of the respective match with the full names and shirt
numbers of the maximum of 26 players listed on the final release list, together
with the full names of the officials eligible to be seated on the team bench.
A maximum of 26 players (including a minimum of two goalkeepers) may be
chosen for the start list. Changes can be made at the team’s discretion up to
90 minutes before kick‑off. The traditional paper start list will also be available
prior to each match.
32.2 The start list should be duly completed by selecting the 11 players who will start
the match and the maximum of 15 substitutes, indicating the captain, selecting
the officials to be seated on the team bench (maximum of 11) and submitted
by the authorised team official and/or signed if applicable. Both teams shall
submit their completed start list at least 90 minutes before kick‑off. If the start
list is not submitted on time for any reason the matter will be reported to the
FIFA Disciplinary Committee. Both teams’ start lists will only be published
once both teams have submitted them, fully completed.
32.3 At the Match Coordination Meeting (before each match), the teams will receive
a start list with the full names and shirt numbers of up to 26 players together
with the full names of the team officials eligible to be seated on the bench.
32.4 The numbers on the players’ shirts must correspond to the numbers indicated
on the start list. Each team is responsible for ensuring that the start list is
completed properly and that only the 11 selected players start the match.
32.5 If, after the submission of the start list, any of the 11 players are not able to
begin the match due to injury or illness, they may be replaced by any of the
eligible substitutes as long as the FIFA Match Director and the referee are
officially informed thereof prior to kick‑off. Within 24 hours, the team concerned
shall also provide FIFA with a medical report issued by a team medical doctor
responsible (in one of the three official FIFA languages).
32.6 Further to the above, any injured or ill player who is removed from the start
list will no longer be eligible to take part in the match and thus cannot be
selected as a substitute player at any time during the match. Such a change
to the start list will not reduce the number of official substitutions that may
be made by a team during the match. Although no longer eligible to play as
a substitute, the injured or ill player who was removed from the start list
before kick‑off may be seated on the team bench and would in that case also
be eligible for doping control selection.
32.7 Only the players who were identified on the official start list submitted to the
FIFA Match Director, or were confirmed as a warm‑up injury/illness replacement
player, may start the match. In the case of any discrepancies of players on the
pitch at the beginning of the match, the matter will be submitted to the FIFA
Disciplinary Committee for a decision.
Article 33: TECHNICAL AND WARM‑UP AREAS
33.1 The technical area is the area which the coach, other team officials and
substitutes are allowed to occupy during the match. It includes the dugout
(if applicable), the team bench and a marked zone adjacent to the pitch.
33.2 No more than 26 people (up to 15 substitute players and up to 11 team officials
– one of these officials shall be a team medical doctor) shall be allowed to sit
on the team bench. A suspended player or team official will not be allowed to
sit on the team bench or be in the technical area during the match.
33.3 Up to 20 additional technical overflow seats (including one seat for the team
liaison officer and one seat for the team security liaison officer) in the stands
shall be allocated for accredited officials providing technical support to the team
during the match (kit manager, assistant physiotherapist, etc.). Staff occupying
such seats shall have access to the dressing rooms with a valid accreditation.
33.4 During the match, substitutes are allowed to leave the technical area to warm
up. At the Match Coordination Meeting, the FIFA Match Director shall explain
exactly where they may warm up.
33.5 A maximum of five players (including the goalkeeper) and one official per
team shall warm up at the same time next to their own team bench. If there
is not sufficient space next to their own team bench, both teams shall warm
up behind the advertising boards to the rear of the goal. If there is insufficient
space behind the goals, both teams shall warm up in the designated area behind
assistant referee no. 1. In this case, three players (including the goalkeeper)
and one official per team may warm up at the same time. In all cases, the
warm‑up may not involve the use of any balls.
33.6 Smoking, vaping and the use of any tobacco‑related products are only allowed
in the designated areas (if made available) and are not allowed in the technical
area, in the vicinity of the field of play or within the competition areas, such as
the dressing rooms.

earpieces, mobile phones/smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, laptops,
etc.) are permitted in the technical area only if used for coaching/tactics or
player welfare in accordance with the Laws of the Game and the FIFA Media
and Marketing Regulations.
33.8 Additional special equipment items (e.g. antennae) for the use of wearable
technology at final competition matches may only be positioned in a dedicated
area of a final competition stadium defined by FIFA, but not in the technical
area of such stadium.
Article 34: MATCH PROTOCOL
34.1 The countdown to kick‑off provided to both teams in advance of the match shall
be strictly complied with by both teams. Each team is responsible for arriving
at the stadium at the latest 90 minutes before the kick‑off of the respective
match. The FIFA flag and the flag of the host country and both competing
Participating Member Associations shall be displayed in the stadium at every
match in accordance with FIFA’s Flag Protocol, unless FIFA states otherwise.
34.2 Unless FIFA states otherwise, the national anthems of the two teams will be
played before each match. The Participating Member Associations shall confirm
their national anthem to FIFA (maximum duration of 90 seconds) by the date
stipulated in the relevant circular.
34.3 The display of political, religious or personal messages or slogans of any
nature in any language or form by players and officials is prohibited at any
time before the match, during the national anthems, during the match and
after the conclusion of the match. The similar display of commercial messages
and slogans of any nature in any language or form by players and officials is
not allowed for the duration of their time at any official activity organised by
FIFA (including official matches and training sessions, as well as during official
press conferences and mixed‑zone activities).
Article 35: OFFICIAL TRAINING SESSIONS, STADIUM
FAMILIARISATION SESSIONS AND
PRE‑MATCH WARM‑UPS
35.1 In order to preserve the quality of the pitch for the matches, no official
training sessions will be allowed on the stadium pitches before any match.
In principle, all Participating Member Associations’ official training sessions
will be conducted at the Team Base Camp Training Sites and/or, if applicable,
Venue‑Specific Training Sites assigned by FIFA (exemptions to this rule may
be granted if pitch conditions allow).
35.2 Teams that are due to play a match in a stadium in which they have not
previously played will be entitled to a familiarisation session in that stadium on
either the day before the match or two days before the match. The players and
team officials will be permitted to walk around the field of play (to inspect the
pitch only and wearing training shoes) and stadium to familiarise themselves
with the set‑up.
35.3 Official training session and stadium familiarisation session times will be
established and communicated by FIFA.
35.4 The teams will be entitled to warm up on the pitch before each match, weather
and pitch conditions permitting. In principle, such warm‑up will be 30 minutes
long and will take place from 50 minutes prior to kick‑off until 20 minutes prior
to kick‑off. If the pitch is not in good condition or if warm‑up sessions would
negatively affect the state of the pitch for the match, or if the pitch is to be
used for ceremonies related to the FIFA World Cup 26, FIFA may shorten or
cancel the warm‑up session timings and/or specify restricted areas of use.

36.5 Players are entitled to a 15‑minute interval at half‑time; a short drinks break
(which should not exceed one minute) is permitted at the interval of half‑time in
extra time. If a match goes into extra time, a break not exceeding five minutes
is permitted before the first period of extra time begins.
36.6 Extreme weather conditions may warrant cooling breaks to be implemented
during the course of a match in accordance with the protocols established by
the FIFA Medical Committee and/or documented in the FIFA Football Emergency
Medicine Manual. Such breaks will be considered on a match‑by‑match basis.
Responsibility for implementing and controlling cooling breaks resides with
the referee.
36.7 Goal‑line technology may be used for the purpose of verifying whether a goal
has been scored to support the referee’s decision. The participating teams

be appointed for each match of the final competition. The decisions of the
FIFA Referees Committee are final and not subject to appeal.
37.2 If the referee or an assistant referee is prevented from carrying out their duties,
such referee or assistant referee shall be replaced by the fourth official and
the reserve assistant referee, respectively. The FIFA Referees Committee will
determine who replaces a fourth official or a reserve assistant referee who
is prevented from carrying out their duties, or who replaces another match
official. In exceptional circumstances, the FIFA Referees Committee may
decide to proceed with either a fourth official or a reserve assistant referee
from the host association, or to play the match without a fourth official or a
reserve assistant referee.
37.3 Immediately, after each match, the referee shall complete the official match
report online form whilst still at the stadium. On the form, the referee shall
note all occurrences of significance, such as misconduct of players leading to
caution or expulsion, unsporting behaviour by supporters and/or by officials

42.1 Each Participating Member Association shall ensure and confirm to FIFA that
its players have undergone a cardiac screening, including personal and family
history, clinical examination and resting 12‑lead ECG, within the last 12 months
and an echocardiography within the last 24 months prior to the start of the
final competition of the FIFA World Cup 26. If specifically performed for the
tournament, FIFA recommends that participating teams use the screening
form developed by FIFA cardiology consultants.
42.2 A non‑contact collapse of a player on the field of play should be treated as a
sudden cardiac arrest until proven otherwise. The medical team of the team and
the field‑of‑play medical team may enter the pitch immediately and commence
resuscitation, without waiting for a signal from the referee. One member of
the field‑of‑play medical team notifies the fourth official of the collapse and
need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
42.3 A player who experiences a suspected concussion during a match must undergo
an examination by the team medical doctor in accordance with the FIFA Medical
Concussion Protocol. The referee may temporarily suspend play for three
minutes whenever an incident of suspected concussion occurs. The referee
may only allow the player to continue playing with the authorisation of the
team medical doctor, who shall have evaluated the player and excluded any
suspicion of a concussive injury. The team medical doctor will have the final
64
decision based on a clinical examination. Under no circumstances should a
player with a suspected concussion return to play.
42.4 FIFA recommends that medical teams follow the graduated return‑to‑play
protocol set forth in the FIFA Concussion Protocol for Medical Staff for any
player who has suffered a concussion. The protocol recognises that the time
frame for return to play may vary, dependent on factors such as the player’s
age, gender, their symptoms and medical history, and that doctors must use
their clinical judgement in making decisions with respect to return to play.
The player’s welfare must be their sole concern. FIFA requires that before any
player who suffers a concussive episode can return to play, the team medical
doctor certify that (a) such player has passed each of the steps set out in the
FIFA Concussion Protocol for Medical Staff, (b) such player is fit for competition
and (c) the team medical doctor has discussed the management of the case with
the FIFA Match Doctor where indicated (subject to consent from the player).
Article 43: DOPING CONTROL
43.1 Doping is strictly prohibited. The FIFA Anti‑Doping Regulations, the FIFA
Disciplinary Code and all other relevant FIFA regulations, circular letters and
directives shall apply to the FIFA World Cup 26.
43.2 Players may be subject to in‑competition testing at the matches in which
they compete and to out‑of‑competition testing at any time and in any place.

ownership and exploitation of commercial rights relating to the FIFA World
Cup 26. All Participating Member Associations shall, and shall ensure that all
of its Delegation Members shall, comply with the FIFA Media and Marketing
Regulations at all times. To the extent that these Regulations are inconsistent
with any aspect of the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations, the FIFA Media
and Marketing Regulations shall take precedence.
44.4 Media matters and obligations for the FIFA World Cup 26 will be outlined in
the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations and corresponding documents
(circular letters, Team Handbook, Media Guidelines, etc.) relating to TV and
media activities. Participating Member Associations and their Delegation
Members shall comply with the stipulations contained within these documents

EVENT NAMES A .
I. GENERAL
1
As part of its campaign to promote fair play, FIFA regularly holds a fair play
contest during its championships, based on an appraisal of the teams’ conduct
by a FIFA delegate such as the FIFA Match Commissioner, a member of the
Technical Study Group or a member of a standing committee.
2
The objective of fair play activities is to foster a sporting spirit among players,
team officials and spectators, thereby heightening the fans’ enjoyment of
the game.
3
At the final whistle of each game, the delegate shall complete the appropriate
fair play form after consulting the referee and the referee assessor.
4
Every match in the final competition shall be taken into account.
5
FIFA shall compile and publish the classification at the end of the final
competition. Its decision is final.
6
As a prize awarded to the Participating Member Association that wins the
FIFA Fair Play Award presented by McDonald’s, FIFA will, on behalf of and
in alignment with McDonald’s, deliver a football‑related social development
(CSR) campaign in the territory of the winning association. The budget for
this CSR campaign shall be up to USD 50,000 (fifty thousand US dollars).
Both McDonald’s and the member association will be consulted on the
campaign; however, FIFA reserves the right to determine the nature of the
campaign, the dates on which it will take place and the exact location where
it will be delivered.

II. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
1
The assessment form contains six criteria by which the teams’ fair play
performance shall be judged, stressing the positive aspects rather than
negative. As a general rule, maximum points shall only be awarded if the team
concerned displays a positive attitude.
2
Red and yellow cards shall be deducted from a maximum of 10 points:
-
first yellow card:

minus 1 point
-
second yellow/indirect red card:
minus 3 points
-
direct red card:

minus 4 points
-
yellow card & direct red card:
minus 5 points
Red and yellow cards are the only criteria entailing minus points.
3
Positive play
Minimum 1 point
Maximum 10 points
The aim of this criterion is to reward attacking and attractive play, and shall
take into account such aspects as:
a) Positive aspects
-
attacking rather than defensive tactics;.
-
speeding up the game;.
-
constantly attempting to score even if the desired result (e.g. qualification)
has already been achieved.
b) Negative aspects.
-
tactics that rely on rough play;
-
play‑acting;
-
time‑wasting etc.
c) As a general rule, positive play is correlated with the number of scoring chances
created and the number of goals scored.
4
Respect towards the opponent
Minimum 1 point
Maximum 5 points
Players are expected to respect the Laws of the Game, the competition
regulations and opponents, etc.
When assessing the players’ behaviour towards the opponents, duplication of
the judgment for red and yellow cards should be avoided. However, the delegate
may take into account the seriousness of the offences punished by cards as
well as those overlooked by the referee.
Assessment shall be based on positive attitudes (e.g. helping an injured
opponent) rather than on infringements. Behaviour that is basically faultless
but does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude or gesture
towards opponents shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5.
5
Respect towards the referee/match officials
Minimum 1 point
Maximum 5 points
Players are expected to respect the match officials and the decisions they take.
A positive attitude towards the referee, including acceptance of decisions
without protest, shall be rewarded. Behaviour that is basically faultless but
does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude or gesture towards
the match officials shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5.
6
Behaviour of the team officials
Minimum 1 point
Maximum 5 points
Coaches and other team officials are expected to encourage the sporting,
technical, tactical and ethical standards of their team and to direct the players
to behave in accordance with the principles of fair play.
Both positive and negative factors in the behaviour of the team officials shall
be included in the assessment, such as for instance whether they calm down
angry players or how they accept the referee’s decisions. Inciting or provoking
players shall be rated negatively.
Annexes
78
79
Cooperation with the media shall also be a factor in the assessment. Behaviour
that is faultless but does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude
or gesture shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5.
7
Behaviour of the crowd
Minimum 1 point
Maximum 5 points
The crowd is considered to be an integral part of a football match. Fans can
contribute to the positive atmosphere of a match by encouraging their team
by cheering and singing, etc. in the spirit of fair play.
Spectators are, however, expected to respect the opponents and the referee.
They should appreciate the opponents’ performance regardless of the result
and in no way intimidate or frighten opponents, the referee or the opponents’
supporters.
The maximum number of points (5) may only be awarded if all these requirements
have been satisfied, especially as regards creating a positive atmosphere.
This criterion is applicable only if a substantial number of fans of the team
concerned are present. If the number of fans is negligible, “n.a.” (not applicable)
shall be entered under this item
III. FINAL ASSESSMENT
1
The final assessment of a team is obtained as follows:
a) the points awarded are added together, e.g. for team A: 8 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 31
b) this total is divided by the maximum number of points possible (40):
31 ÷ 40 = 0.775
c) this figure is multiplied by 1,000: 0.775 x 1,000 = 775
If, however, the number of fans supporting a certain team is negligible and
the “behaviour of the crowd” criterion consequently disregarded (“n.a.” – cf.
art. II par. 7 of the fair play contest regulations), the maximum number of
points obtainable will be 35.
Thus the final assessment would be attained as follows:
a) the points awarded are added together, e.g. for team B: 7 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 24
b) this total is divided by the maximum number of points possible (35):
24 ÷ 35 = 0.686
c) this figure is multiplied by 1,000: 0.686 x 1,000 = 686
The overall assessment of a team during the final competition shall be calculated
by adding the points attained at each match and dividing this figure by the
number of matches played.
2
Teams that are eliminated after the group stage of the final competition shall
be excluded from the fair play contest.
In addition to making the assessment, members of FIFA may give a short oral
account of the teams’ fair play performance to explain the positive and negative
factors, which form the basis of their assessment. The account may also point
out any outstanding gestures of fair play from a player, official, referee or any
other person. However, no additional points shall be awarded for this reason.
