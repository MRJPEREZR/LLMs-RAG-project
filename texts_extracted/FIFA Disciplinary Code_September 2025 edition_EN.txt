General
Provisions

1.
OBJECT

sanctions incurred, regulates the organisation and function of the FIFA judicial bodies
responsible for taking decisions and the procedures to be followed before said bodies.
2.
SCOPE OF APPLICATION: SUBSTANTIVE LAW

This Code applies to every match and competition organised by FIFA and to
matches and competitions in association football that do not fall under the
jurisdiction of the confederations and/or the member associations, unless
otherwise stipulated in this Code.

1.
This Code applies to all disciplinary offences committed following the date on
which it comes into force.
2.
This Code also applies to all disciplinary offences committed prior to the date on
which it comes into force, subject to any milder sanction that would apply under
previous rules.
3.
Disciplinary proceedings instigated against someone who was under
FIFA’s jurisdiction as per article 3 on the day the alleged disciplinary offence was
committed shall not be abandoned by the FIFA judicial bodies solely because the
person involved is no longer under FIFA’s jurisdiction.
5.
APPLICABLE LAW
The FIFA judicial bodies base their decisions:
a) primarily, on the FIFA Statutes as well as FIFA’s regulations, circulars, directives
and decisions, and the Laws of the Game; and

team players and officials. The same applies to clubs in respect of their players
and officials.
6.
The disciplinary measures provided for in this Code may be combined.
7.
DIRECTIVES
1.
Directives require those affected by them to behave in a certain manner.
2.
In addition to disciplinary measures, the FIFA judicial bodies may issue directives
stipulating the manner in which a disciplinary measure must be carried out,
including the date and conditions on which the disciplinary measure is enforced.
3.
The FIFA judicial bodies may also award compensation for damage where an
association or club is liable for that damage on the basis of article 8 or 17.
General Provisions
I.
11
8.
RESPONSIBILITY
1.
Unless otherwise specified in this Code, infringements are punishable regardless
of whether they have been committed deliberately or negligently. In particular,
member associations and clubs may be responsible for the behaviour of their
members, players, officials or supporters or any other person carrying out a
function on their behalf even if the association or club concerned can prove the
absence of any fault or negligence.
2.
Acts amounting to attempt are also punishable.
3.
Anyone who takes part in committing an infringement or induces someone to do
so, whether as instigator or accomplice, may also be sanctioned.
9.
DECISIONS OF THE REFEREE
1.
Decisions taken by the referee on the field of play are final and may not be reviewed
by the FIFA judicial bodies.
2.
In cases where a decision by the referee involves an obvious error (such as
mistaking the identity of the person penalised), the FIFA judicial bodies may
only review the disciplinary consequences of that decision. In cases of mistaken
identity, disciplinary proceedings may, in accordance with this Code, be opened
only against the person who was actually at fault.
3.
A protest against a caution or a sending-off from the field of play after two cautions
is admissible only if the referee’s error was to mistake the identity of the player.
4.
In cases of serious misconduct, disciplinary action may be taken even if the referee
and their assistants did not see the event in question and were therefore unable
to take any action.
5.
The provisions of this Code relating to protests against match results affected
by a referee’s decision that was an obvious violation of a rule remain applicable.
10. LIMITATION PERIOD FOR PROSECUTION
1.
Infringements may no longer be prosecuted in accordance with the following
periods:
a) two years for infringements committed during a match;
b) ten years for anti-doping rule violations (as defined in the FIFA Anti‑Doping
Regulations), infringements relating to international transfers involving minors,
and match manipulation;
c) five years for all other offences.
12
2.
The limitation period runs as follows:
a) from the day on which the perpetrator committed the infringement;
b) if the infringement is recurrent, from the day on which the most recent
infringement was committed;
c) if the infringement lasted for a certain period, from the day on which it ended;
d) from the day on which the decision of the Football Tribunal or the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) becomes final and binding.
3.
The limitation periods set out above are interrupted by all procedural acts, starting
afresh with each interruption.
11. DUTY TO REPORT
1.
Anyone subject to this Code shall immediately report to the secretariat of the
Disciplinary Committee any violation of, or attempt to violate, this Code by any
third party.
2.
Anyone subject to this Code who makes an unfounded or irresponsible accusation
may be sanctioned.
12. DUTY TO COLLABORATE
1.
The parties shall act in good faith throughout the proceedings.
2.
The parties or the persons subject to this Code shall collaborate to establish the
facts and, in particular, comply with requests for information from a FIFA body,
committee, subsidiary or instance, as well as from the FIFA administration.
3.
In particular, persons subject to this Code shall help to establish and/or clarify
the facts of a case or any possible breaches of this Code and, in particular, shall
provide any evidence requested.
4.
Any breach of this article by any person subject to this Code may lead to the
appropriate sanctions being imposed by the relevant judicial body.
5.
If the parties fail to collaborate, especially if they ignore the stipulated time limits,
the judicial body may nonetheless reach a decision on the case using the file in
its possession.

CHAPTER 1. INFRINGEMENTS OF THE LAWS OF
THE GAME
13. OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOUR AND VIOLATIONS OF THE
PRINCIPLES OF FAIR PLAY
1.
Member associations and clubs, as well as their players, officials and any other
member and/or person carrying out a function on their behalf, must respect the
Laws of the Game, as well as the FIFA Statutes and FIFA’s regulations, directives,
guidelines, circulars and decisions, and comply with the principles of fair play,
loyalty and integrity.
2.
For example, anyone who acts in any of the following ways may be subject to
disciplinary measures:
a) violating the basic rules of decent conduct;
b) insulting a natural or legal person in any way, especially by using offensive
gestures, signs or language;
c) using a sports event for demonstrations of a non-sporting nature;
d) behaving in a way that brings the sport of football and/or FIFA into disrepute;
e) actively altering the age of players shown on the identity cards they produce
at competitions that are subject to age limits.
Offences
II.

CHAPTER 2. DISORDERLINESS AT MATCHES AND
COMPETITIONS
14. MISCONDUCT OF PLAYERS AND OFFICIALS
1.
Players and officials shall be suspended for misconduct as specified below and
may be fined accordingly:
a) one match for players who are sent off for denying the opposing team a goal
or an obvious goalscoring opportunity;
b) at least one match or an appropriate period of time for unsporting behaviour
towards an opponent or a person other than a match official;
c) at least one match for officials who are sent off for dissent by word or action;
d) at least one match for deliberately receiving a yellow or red card, including
in order to be suspended for an upcoming match or to ultimately have a
clean record;
e) at least two matches for serious foul play;
f) at least two matches for provoking spectators at a match by any means;
g) at least two matches or a specific period for acting with obvious intent to
cause a match official to make an incorrect decision or supporting their error
of judgement and thereby causing them to make an incorrect decision;
h) at least three matches for violent conduct;
i) at least three matches or an appropriate period of time for assault, including
elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting at or hitting an opponent or a
person other than a match official;
j) at least four matches or an appropriate period of time for unsporting behaviour
towards a match official;
k) at least ten matches or an appropriate period of time for intimidating or
threatening a match official;
l) at least 15 matches or an appropriate period of time for assaulting a match
official, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting.
2.
The misconduct described in paragraph 1 b), f), j) and k) is also subject to the
respective sanctions in this Code, despite the fact that the offence has been
committed off the field of play (including via social networks).
16
3.
If the suspension is to be served in terms of matches, only those actually played
by the respective team count towards execution of the suspension. It is not
necessary for a player to be included on the team sheet for the respective match
or competition in order for a match suspension to be considered served.
4.
A player or official who, in the context of a match (including pre‑ and post‑match)
or competition, publicly incites others to hatred or violence will be sanctioned with
a ban on taking part in any football-related activity for no less than six months
and with a minimum fine of CHF 5,000. In serious cases, in addition to the above
sanctions and in particular if the infringement is committed using social networks
and/or the mass media (such as the press, radio or television) or takes place on a
matchday in or around a stadium, the minimum fine will be CHF 20,000.
5.
If a national or club team conducts itself improperly (for example, if individual
disciplinary sanctions are imposed by the referee on five or more players – three
or more in the case of futsal – during a match), disciplinary measures may also be
taken against the association or club concerned.
6.
Additional disciplinary measures may also be imposed in all cases.
15. DISCRIMINATION AND RACIST ABUSE
1.
Any person who offends the dignity or integrity of a country, a person or group of
people through contemptuous, discriminatory or derogatory words or actions on
account of race, skin colour, ethnicity, nationality, social origin, gender, disability,
sexual orientation, language, religion, political or any other opinion, wealth, birth or
any other status or any other reason shall be sanctioned with a suspension lasting
at least ten matches or a specific period, or any other appropriate disciplinary
measure.
2.
Member associations and clubs shall take all necessary and reasonable measures
to ban from entering stadiums any person who has been charged with, or found
guilty of, having racially abused a player, match official, coach, other team official or
any other person exercising an official role during a match through contemptuous,
discriminatory or derogatory words or actions on account of race, skin colour,
descent, nationality or ethnicity, including via social media or any other digital
platform or written medium.
3.
In the event of racist abuse occurring during a match, the referee will implement
FIFA’s three-step anti-discrimination procedure, in line with the relevant regulations
and circular letters. The procedure allows the referee to 1) stop the match,
2) suspend the match and 3) abandon the match.
4.
Any player or official who is the victim of racist abuse by the crowd during a match
may inform the referee by using the appropriate gesture, as outlined in the relevant
FIFA rules, or by any other means. The referee may then immediately implement
the first step of FIFA’s three-step anti-discrimination procedure, as described in
Offences
II.
17
paragraph 3 above. Subsequently, the host club, member association or organising
authority shall immediately deploy the necessary personnel to the relevant section
of the stadium with the aim of stopping the racist abuse. The player or official
may also identify the person(s) involved in perpetrating such abuse and request
that they be removed from the stadium whenever possible. If they cannot be
removed due to security reasons and the racist abuse continues, the referee may
implement the second step of FIFA’s three-step anti-discrimination procedure
until the abuse desists.
5.
In cases where the racist abuse has been personally verified by the referee and
the second step of FIFA’s three-step anti-discrimination procedure (i.e. suspend
the match) has been applied per paragraph 3 above, the player or official who
has been subjected to the abuse may provide the Disciplinary Committee with
a victim statement. If the club or member association concerned is unable to
provide enough evidence or clarification to disprove the racist abuse alleged by the
player or official, the player or official’s statement will be accepted. In such cases,
and after all the relevant circumstances have been considered, the Disciplinary
Committee may decide to declare the match forfeited by the responsible club or
member association.
6.
If one or more supporters of a representative team or club engage in the behaviour
described in paragraph 1 above, the member association or club responsible will
be subject to the following disciplinary measures, even if the member association
or club concerned can prove the absence of any fault or negligence:
a) For a first offence, playing a match with a limited number of spectators and
a fine of at least CHF 20,000 shall be imposed on the association or club
concerned, unless this would lead to an unreasonable financial impact on the
affected member association or club, in which case the fine may be reduced, on
an exceptional basis, to no less than CHF 1,000. As an exception to article 6.4
of this Code, the maximum fine to be imposed in cases of racist abuse against
a player, match official, coach, other team official or any other person exercising
an official role during a match shall be CHF 5,000,000;
b) For recidivists or repeat incidents, or if the circumstances of the case require
it, disciplinary measures such as the implementation of a prevention plan,
a fine, a points deduction, playing one or more matches without spectators,
a ban on playing in a particular stadium, the forfeiting of a match, expulsion
from a competition or relegation to a lower division may be imposed on the
association or club concerned.
7.
The competent judicial body may deviate from the above minimum sanctions if
the association and/or club concerned commits to developing, in conjunction
with FIFA, a comprehensive plan to ensure action against discrimination and to
prevent repeated incidents. The plan shall be approved by FIFA and shall include,
at least, the following three focus areas:
18
a) Educational activities (including a communication campaign aimed at
supporters and the general public). The effectiveness of the campaign will be
reviewed regularly.
b) Stadium security and dialogue measures (including a policy on how offenders
will be identified and dealt with through football sanctions, a policy on
escalation to state (criminal) legal authorities, and a dialogue with supporters
and influencers on how to create change).
c) Partnerships (including working with supporters, NGOs, experts and
stakeholders to advise on and support the action plan and ensure effective
and ongoing implementation).
8.
Persons who are bound by this Code and have been the victim of potential
discriminatory behaviour may be invited by the respective judicial body to make
an oral or written victim impact statement, and will have the right to request the
motivated decision in proceedings before the judicial bodies, as well as to lodge
an appeal and act as party in the disciplinary appeal proceedings in accordance
with the applicable provisions of this Code.
9.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, if a match is abandoned by the
referee because of discriminatory behaviour and/or racist abuse, the match shall
be declared forfeited.
16. UNPLAYED MATCHES AND ABANDONMENT
1.
If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full for reasons other than force
majeure, but due to the behaviour of a team or behaviour for which an association
or a club is liable, the association or the club will be sanctioned with a minimum
fine of CHF 10,000. The match will either be forfeited or replayed.
2.
Additional disciplinary measures may be imposed on the association or club
concerned.
3.
If a match was abandoned and is to be replayed in full, any caution issued during
that match shall be annulled. If a match was abandoned, in particular for reasons
of force majeure, and it recommences at the minute at which play was interrupted,
any caution imposed before the match was abandoned remains valid for the
remainder of the match. If the match is not to be replayed, the cautions received
by the teams shall be upheld.
Offences
II.
19
17. ORDER AND SECURITY AT MATCHES
1.
Host clubs and member associations are responsible for order and security both
in and around the stadium before, during and after matches. Without prejudice
to their responsibility for the inappropriate behaviour of their own supporters,
they are liable for incidents of any kind, including but not limited to those listed in
paragraph 2 below, and may be subject to disciplinary measures and directives
unless they can prove that they have not been negligent in any way in the
organisation of the match. In particular, member associations, clubs and licensed
match agents who organise matches shall:
a) assess the degree of risk posed by the match and notify the FIFA bodies of
those that are especially high-risk;
b) comply with and implement existing safety rules (FIFA regulations, national
laws, international agreements) and take every safety precaution demanded
by the circumstances in and around the stadium before, during and after the
match and if incidents occur;
c) ensure the safety of the match officials and the players and officials of the
visiting team during their stay;
d) keep local authorities informed and collaborate with them actively and
effectively;
e) ensure that law and order are maintained in and around the stadiums and that
matches are organised properly.
2.
All member associations and clubs are liable for inappropriate behaviour on the
part of one or more of their supporters as stated below and may be subject to
disciplinary measures and directives even if they can prove the absence of any
negligence in relation to the organisation of the match:
a) the invasion or attempted invasion of the field of play;
b) the throwing of objects;
c) the lighting of fireworks or any other objects;
d) the use of laser pointers or similar electronic devices;
e) the use of gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit a message
that is not appropriate for a sports event, particularly messages that are of a
political, ideological, religious or offensive nature;
f) acts of damage;
g) causing a disturbance during national anthems;
h) any other lack of order or discipline observed in or around the stadium.
20
18. PROTESTS
1.
Member associations and their clubs are entitled to lodge protests. Protests must
reach the Disciplinary Committee in writing via the FIFA Legal Portal, indicating
the relevant grounds, within 24 hours of the end of the match in question.
2.
The 24-hour time limit cannot be extended. For the sake of the smooth running
of the competition, the corresponding competition regulations may shorten the
protest deadline accordingly.
3.
The protest fee is CHF 1,000. It must be paid when the protest is lodged and is
reimbursed only if the protest is admitted in full.
4.
A protest is admissible only if the protest fee is paid in accordance with paragraph 3
above and only if it is based on:
a) an ineligible player’s participation in a match as a consequence of that player
not fulfilling the conditions defined in the relevant FIFA regulations;
b) an unfit field of play, as long as the referee was informed as soon as the problem
was reported or observed (whether in writing before the match, or orally by a
team captain, in the presence of the captain of the opposing team, during the
match);
c) an obvious error by the referee as defined in article 9 of this Code, in which
case the protest may be directed only at the disciplinary consequences of the
referee’s obvious error.
19. FIELDING AN INELIGIBLE PLAYER
1.
If a player fielded in a match and/or competition is declared ineligible, the FIFA
judicial bodies, taking into consideration the integrity of the competition
concerned, may impose any appropriate disciplinary measures.
2.
If a player fielded in a match is declared ineligible following a protest, the team to
which the player belongs will be sanctioned by forfeiting the match and paying a
minimum fine of CHF 6,000. The player may also be sanctioned.
3.
The Disciplinary Committee may act ex officio.
Offences
II.
21
20. MANIPULATION OF FOOTBALL MATCHES AND
COMPETITIONS
1.
Anyone who directly or indirectly, by an act or an omission, unlawfully influences or
manipulates the course, result or any other aspect of a match and/or competition or
conspires or attempts to do so by any means shall be sanctioned with a minimum
five-year ban on taking part in any football‑related activity as well as a fine of at
least CHF 100,000. In serious cases, a longer ban period, including a potential
lifetime ban on taking part in any football-related activity, shall be imposed.
2.
If a player or official engages in behaviour described in paragraph 1, the club or
association to which the player or official belongs may be sanctioned with the
forfeiting of the match in question or may be declared ineligible to participate in
a different competition, provided the integrity of the competition is protected.
Additional disciplinary measures may be imposed.
3.
Persons bound by this Code must cooperate fully with FIFA at all times in its efforts
to combat such behaviour and shall therefore immediately and voluntarily report
to the secretariat of the Disciplinary Committee any approach in connection
with activities and/or information directly or indirectly related to the possible
manipulation of a football match or competition as described above. Any breach
of this provision shall be sanctioned with a ban of at least two years on taking part
in any football related activity and a fine of at least CHF 15,000.
4.
The Disciplinary Committee shall be competent to investigate and adjudicate all
conduct on and off the field of play in connection with the manipulation of football
matches and competitions.
22
CHAPTER 3. OTHER PROVISIONS
21. FAILURE TO RESPECT DECISIONS
1.
Anyone who fails to pay another person (such as a player, a coach or a club) or
FIFA a sum of money in full or part, even though instructed to do so by a body, a
committee, a subsidiary or an instance of FIFA or a CAS decision (financial decision),
or anyone who fails to comply with another final decision (non-financial decision)
passed by a body, a committee, a subsidiary or an instance of FIFA, or by CAS:
a) may be fined for failing to comply with a decision and receive any pertinent
additional disciplinary measure; and, if necessary:
b) will be granted a final deadline in which to pay the amount due or to comply
with the non-financial decision;
c) may be ordered to pay an interest rate of 18% p.a. to the creditor as from the
date of the decision of the Disciplinary Committee rendered in connection to
a CAS decision on an appeal against a (financial) decision passed by a body,
a committee, a subsidiary or an instance of FIFA;
d) in the case of clubs, upon expiry of the aforementioned final deadline and in the
event of persistent default or failure to comply in full with the decision within
the period stipulated, a ban on registering new players will be issued until the
complete amount due is paid or the non-financial decision is complied with.
A deduction of points or relegation to a lower division may also be ordered in
addition to a ban on registering new players in the event of persistent failure
(i.e. the ban on registering new players has been served for more than three

3.
If the sanctioned person disregards the final time limit, FIFA and/or the relevant
association (in cases involving clubs or natural persons) shall implement the
sanctions imposed. Where a registration ban (in the case of a club), a ban on
any football-related activity (in the case of a natural person) or a disciplinary
measure (in the case of member associations) has been enforced against a
debtor in accordance with this article in relation to a financial obligation resulting
from a CAS or FIFA decision and where the debtor provides FIFA with reliable
evidence of having complied with such decision, such ban or measure may be
provisionally lifted.
The creditor will be invited to confirm whether such payment has been made.
a) Should the debtor have provided accurate information and fully settled its
financial obligation, the ban or measure is considered permanently lifted.
b) Should the debtor have provided inaccurate information and/or have failed
to comply with its financial obligation in full, the Disciplinary Committee may
decide to:
i. reinstate the ban or measure; and
ii. impose additional disciplinary measures.
4.
The sporting successor of a non-compliant party shall also be considered a
non‑compliant party and thus subject to the obligations under this provision.
Criteria to assess whether an entity is to be considered as the sporting
successor of another entity are, among others, its headquarters, name, legal
form, team colours, players, shareholders or stakeholders or ownership and the
category of competition concerned.
5.
With regard to financial decisions passed by a body, a committee, a subsidiary
or an instance of FIFA, or CAS, creditors are expected to remain vigilant and take
prompt legal action to enforce any financial claims arising from such decisions,
including by actively registering their claims in accordance with the relevant
domestic insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, unless said claims are registered
ex officio in those proceedings.
a) Debtors must notify creditors in a timely and reasonable manner about the
initiation of domestic insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, and no later than
15 days after becoming aware of the initiation of such proceedings. They must
also outline the creditors’ rights in the proceedings and the methods available
to the creditors for registering a claim.
b) Creditors shall be considered negligent if they fail to register their claims
without valid justification and despite having been informed by the debtor
about the initiation of domestic insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.
c) Creditors shall not be considered negligent if they are unable to register their
claims in the relevant domestic insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings if the
24
financial decision passed by a body, a committee, a subsidiary or an instance
of FIFA, or CAS, is issued when the domestic registration period for claims has
expired and cannot be reopened.

Any financial or non-financial decision that has been issued against a club by
a competent decision-making body within the relevant association shall be
enforced by the association of the deciding body that has issued the decision in
accordance with the principles established in this article and in compliance with
the applicable disciplinary regulations. An association will be fined for failing to
enforce the decision in accordance with this article. In the event of persistent
failure to enforce the decision, additional disciplinary measures may be imposed
on the association.
7.
Any financial or non-financial decision that has been issued against a natural
person by a competent decision-making body within the relevant association
shall be enforced by the association of the deciding body that has issued the
decision or by the natural person’s new association, if the natural person has,
in the meantime, been registered or licensed at another association, or otherwise
employed by a club affiliated to another association or by another association, in
accordance with the principles established in this article and in compliance with
the applicable disciplinary regulations. An association will be fined for failing to
enforce the decision in accordance with this article. In the event of persistent
failure to enforce the decision, additional disciplinary measures may be imposed
on the association.
8.
Any financial decision issued by the Football Tribunal or FIFA imposing disciplinary
measures, such as a ban from registering any new players – either nationally or
internationally – or a restriction on playing in official matches, will be automatically
enforced by FIFA and the relevant member association. FIFA will be competent to
deal with any issue relating to the enforcement of such decisions, including but not
limited to the potential recognition of the sporting successor and the assessment
of potential insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.
9.
Where a decision issued by the FIFA Football Tribunal or a proposal confirmed
by the FIFA general secretariat contains consequences for failure to pay relevant
amounts on time and the debtor has not provided proof of payment after such
consequences have been served in full, the Disciplinary Committee may decide to
provisionally extend such consequences until a final decision has been rendered
by this judicial body in accordance with this article.
10.
The Disciplinary Committee shall be competent to decide on cases related to the
failure to respect settlement agreements concluded in the context of disciplinary
proceedings opened against a debtor with respect to a final and binding financial
decision issued by a body, a committee, a subsidiary or an instance of FIFA or by
CAS. This shall include private agreements concluded after any decision passed
by a body, a committee, a subsidiary or an instance of FIFA or by CAS and made
in order to settle their dispute.

The judicial body determines the type and extent of the disciplinary measures to be
imposed in accordance with the objective and subjective elements of the offence,
taking into account both aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
2.
Disciplinary measures may be limited to a geographical area or to one or more
specific categories of match or competition.
3.
When determining the disciplinary measure, the judicial body shall take into
account all relevant factors of the case, including any assistance of and substantial
cooperation by the offender in uncovering or establishing a breach of any FIFA
rule, the circumstances and the degree of the offender’s guilt and any other
relevant circumstances.
4.
In exercising its discretionary powers, the relevant FIFA judicial body may scale
down the disciplinary measure to be imposed or even dispense with it entirely.
26. RECIDIVISM

27. SUSPENSION OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCIPLINARY
MEASURES
1.
The judicial body may decide to fully or partially suspend the implementation of
a disciplinary measure.
2.
By suspending the implementation of the sanction, the judicial body subjects the
person sanctioned to a probationary period of one to four years.
3.
If the person benefiting from a suspended sanction commits another infringement
of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension shall
be revoked by the judicial body and the sanction enforced without prejudice to
any additional sanction imposed for the new infringement.
4.
Disciplinary measures relating to match manipulation cannot be suspended.
28. FORFEIT
1.
A team sanctioned with a forfeit is considered to have lost the match 3-0 in
11-a-side football, 5-0 in futsal or 10-0 in beach soccer. If the goal difference at
the end of the match is less favourable to the team at fault, the result on the pitch
is upheld.
2.
Cautions issued in a match that is subsequently forfeited shall not be annulled.
29. MATCHES TO BE PLAYED WITHOUT SPECTATORS
To the extent that the competent judicial body decides otherwise, no one shall be
allowed to attend a match that has been ordered to be played without spectators, with
the exception of:

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
30. GENERAL RULE
1.
The FIFA judicial bodies shall be competent to investigate, prosecute and sanction
conduct within the scope of application of this Code.
2.
Confederations, member associations and other sports organisations are
responsible for investigating, prosecuting and sanctioning conduct in their
respective jurisdictions. In particular, confederations shall have jurisdiction on
disciplinary matters related to friendly matches and competitions between
representative teams or clubs belonging to the same confederation, provided that
the competition is not organised by FIFA.
3.
FIFA shall have jurisdiction on disciplinary matters related to matches and
competitions organised by it, to international “A” friendly matches (tier‑1
international matches), to friendly matches and competitions between
representative teams or clubs belonging to different confederations or to matches
involving invitational teams composed of players registered with clubs belonging
to member associations of different confederations.
4.
Each member association has a duty to cooperate with other member associations
to forward and notify them of documents or to provide information related to
and/or required for domestic disciplinary proceedings. If a member association
fails to cooperate in this way, it may lead to sanctions as provided under this Code.
5.
Confederations and member associations shall inform FIFA immediately of
the sanctions issued by their respective judicial bodies in relation to serious
infringements (including but not limited to doping, manipulation of football
matches and competitions, sexual abuse or harassment).
6.
In exceptional circumstances, after consultation with the relevant panel or
committee competent to support FIFA’s global stand against racism, FIFA may
decide to lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against
any decision issued by the relevant judicial body of a member association in cases
of racist abuse towards a player, match official, coach, other team official or any
other person exercising an official role during a match, whenever such a decision
appears to contravene article 15 of this Code.
7.
The FIFA judicial bodies reserve the right to investigate, prosecute and sanction
serious infringements within the scope of application of this Code – in particular,
doping, match-fixing and discrimination – that fall within the jurisdiction of
confederations, member associations or other sports organisations, if deemed
appropriate in a specific case and if no formal investigation has been initiated by
the competent confederation, member association or other sports organisation
90 days after the matter became known to FIFA, or if the relevant confederation,
Organisation and Competence
III.
31
member association or sports organisation agrees with FIFA to confer the
competence regarding the relevant matter on FIFA.
8.
In particular, for cases of racist abuse towards a player, match official, coach, other
team official or any other person exercising an official role during a match, FIFA
reserves the right to investigate, prosecute and sanction the relevant offender(s)
if no formal investigation has been opened after 14 days of the matter becoming
known to FIFA or if no decision has been rendered by the relevant member
association in line with the relevant provisions of article 15 of this Code.
9.
The FIFA judicial bodies shall not deal with cases that have been previously subject
to a final decision by another FIFA body involving the same party or parties and
the same cause of action. In such cases, the claim shall be deemed inadmissible.

bodies shall be impartial and fulfil the independence criteria as defined in the
FIFA Governance Regulations.
2.
Members of the FIFA judicial bodies may not decide on a matter where there are
legitimate grounds for questioning their independence or impartiality and/or if
there is a conflict of interest. They shall disclose any circumstance which may
give rise to any such ground.
3.
Members who decline to participate in a meeting on any of the above grounds
shall notify the chairperson immediately.
4.
If the circumstances give rise to legitimate doubts over the independence or
impartiality of a member of the FIFA judicial body, a party is entitled to challenge
said member at the latest two days prior to the relevant date on which the judicial
body is called to decide on a matter.

The chairperson shall decide on any such challenge. If an objection is raised
concerning the chairperson, the deputy chairperson or, in their absence,
the longest-serving member present shall decide on such challenge.

member shall be suspended from the Disciplinary Committee until the next
FIFA Congress.

Disciplinary Committee confirms them in writing to the association or club
concerned or, in the case of final competitions, to the head of the delegation
concerned (or the person(s) indicated by the latter for each competition). To ensure

the questioning of individuals. Other investigative procedures may also be
employed, including but not limited to on‑site inspections, document requests
and the procurement of expert opinions.
An investigation may be reopened if new evidence or facts emerge which imply
that an offence falling within the scope of this Code may have been committed.

to the parties or their legal representatives, the time limit starts on the day after
receipt of the document by such person.
4.
When a deadline expires on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in the Swiss
canton of Zurich, where FIFA´s headquarters are located, it is carried forward to

48. COMMUNICATION WITH THE PARTIES
1.
All of the parties shall be notified of the decision.
2.
All communications between FIFA and the party concerned during proceedings
before the FIFA judicial bodies shall be sent exclusively through the FIFA Legal

2.
Cautions, sendings-off and automatic match suspensions have an immediate
effect on subsequent matches even if the notification reaches the association,
club or head of delegation concerned later.
51. PROVISIONAL MEASURES
1.
The chairperson of the competent judicial body, or their nominee, is entitled
to issue provisional measures where these are deemed necessary to ensure
the proper administration of justice, to maintain sporting discipline or to avoid
irreparable harm, or for reasons of safety and security. They are not obliged to
hear the parties.
2.
Provisional measures issued by the chairperson of the Disciplinary Committee or
their nominee may be appealed against in accordance with the relevant provisions

club concerned, which must then, if applicable, inform the club or the individual
in person. All such communications by FIFA or the FIFA judicial bodies shall be
sent by the secretariat via the FIFA Legal Portal.
10.
Written communications to FIFA by an association, club or individual shall be
submitted via the FIFA Legal Portal.
54. DECISIONS
1.
Decisions are passed by a single judge or by a simple majority of the members
present. If votes are equal, the chairperson has the casting vote.
2.
The FIFA judicial bodies may take decisions via personal meetings, telephone
conference, video conference or any other similar method.
3.
In principle, the FIFA judicial bodies issue the terms of decisions without grounds,
and only these terms of the decision are notified to the parties, who are informed
that they have ten days from that notification to request, in writing via the FIFA
Legal Portal, a motivated decision. Failure to make such a request results in the
decision becoming final and binding and the parties being deemed to have waived
their right to lodge an appeal.
4.
A motivated decision shall include at least:
a) a brief summary of the facts, which does not need to include every single
contention;
b) the article(s) infringed;
c) the considerations that are relevant to the potential breach of the FIFA
regulations; and
d) the criteria used to determine the possible sanction.
5.
If the motivated decision is requested within the time limit stipulated in
paragraph 3 above, the time limit for lodging an appeal begins only on notification
of the motivation. Only the parties to which a decision is addressed can request
the motivation.
6.
Any appeal lodged before notification of the motivated decision is regarded
exclusively as a request for motivation.
7.
Doping-related decisions are issued with grounds. In case of urgency, or under
any other special circumstances, the relevant judicial body may notify the party
of only the terms of the decision, which become immediately applicable. The full,
written decision shall then be notified within 60 days.
42
8.
The FIFA secretariat publishes decisions issued by the FIFA judicial bodies.
Where such a decision contains confidential information, FIFA may decide,
ex officio or at the request of a party, to publish an anonymised or a redacted
version.
9.
The request for a motivated decision does not affect the enforcement of the
decision, which shall take effect as soon as it is notified, with the exception of
orders to pay a sum of money.
10.
The competent judicial body may rectify any mistakes in calculation or any other
obvious errors in the decision at any time.

violations where the sanction is not listed in paragraph 1.
58. PROPOSAL BY THE SECRETARIAT
In matters reserved for the single judge, the secretariat may propose a sanction on the
basis of the existing file. The party concerned may reject the proposed sanction and
submit its position before the relevant judicial body by the stipulated deadline, in the
absence of which the proposed sanction will become final and binding.

CHAPTER 4. APPEAL COMMITTEE
60. JURISDICTION
1.

Disciplinary Committee’s decisions that FIFA regulations do not declare as final
or referable to another body, as well as on cases referred by the chairperson of the
Disciplinary Committee or their deputy for consideration and decision.
2.
The Appeal Committee is also competent to decide appeals against decisions of
the Ethics Committee, as set out in the FIFA Code of Ethics.

Any party intending to lodge an appeal must inform the Appeal Committee
of its intention to appeal, in writing via the FIFA Legal Portal, within three days of
notification of the grounds of the decision.
4.
Within five days of expiry of the time limit for the declaration of appeal, the
appellant must file, in writing via the FIFA Legal Portal, the appeal brief. This must
contain the appellant’s requests, an account of the facts, evidence, a list of the
proposed witnesses (with a brief summary of their expected testimony) and the
appellant’s conclusions. The appellant is not authorised to produce further written
submissions or evidence after the deadline for filing the appeal brief.
5.
In urgent cases and during final competitions, the chairperson may shorten the
deadline for the submission of the above-mentioned documents.
6.
The appeal fee is CHF 1,000, payable on submission of the appeal brief at the latest.

b) a reprimand;
c) a suspension of up to two matches or of up to two months (with the exception

2.
Only the motivated decision can be appealed against.
Organisation and Competence
III.
47
3.
If the Disciplinary Committee combines disciplinary measures, an appeal is
admissible if at least one of the disciplinary measures imposed exceeds the above
limits. In this case, the subsequent instance(s) will only be entitled to examine the
sanctions that exceed the above limit.
62. STANDING TO APPEAL
1.
Anyone who has been a party to the proceedings before the Disciplinary
Committee may lodge an appeal with the Appeal Committee, provided this party
has a legally protected interest in filing the appeal.
2.
Member associations and clubs may appeal against decisions sanctioning their
players, officials or members.
63. DELIBERATIONS AND DECISIONS
1.
The Appeal Committee deliberates behind closed doors.
2.
Within the framework of the appeal proceedings, the Appeal Committee has full
power to review the facts and the law.
3.
The decision by the Appeal Committee upholds, amends or overturns the
contested decision. In the case of a fundamental mistrial, the Appeal Committee
can overturn the contested decision and refer the case back to the Disciplinary
Committee for reassessment.
4.
If the accused is the only party to have lodged an appeal, the sanction cannot
be increased.
5.
If new disciplinary offences come to light while appeal proceedings are pending,
they may be judged in the course of the same proceedings. In such a situation,
the sanction can be increased.
64. JURISDICTION OF THE CHAIRPERSON RULING ALONE
The chairperson (or in their absence, the deputy chairperson) of the Appeal Committee
may take the following decisions alone:
a) on a preliminary procedural issue related to the appeal, including the
admissibility of the appeal;
b) in urgent or protest cases;
c) on an appeal against a decision to extend a sanction;
d) to resolve disputes arising from objections to members of the Appeal
Committee;
48
e) on appeals against provisional decisions passed by the chairperson of the
Disciplinary Committee;
f) issue, alter and annul provisional measures;
g) in cases where the sanction imposed by the Disciplinary Committee is a fine
of up to CHF 500,000 or a suspension from playing or carrying out a function
for up to five matches or a period of time up to 12 months; and/or
h) at the request of the parties.
65. EFFECTS OF APPEAL
1.
The appeal does not have a suspensive effect except with regard to orders to
pay a sum of money.
2.
The chairperson, the deputy chairperson or, in their absence, the longest‑serving
member available, may, on receipt of a reasoned request, award a stay of execution.
Special
Procedures
IV.
50
66. EXPULSION AND MATCH SUSPENSION
1.
A player who has been sent off:
a) shall stay in the team dressing room or the doping control room, accompanied
by a chaperone, until the names of the players selected for the doping test are
communicated. The player may be allowed to sit in the stands, provided their
integrity and security are safeguarded, they are not picked for doping control
and are no longer wearing their football equipment;
b) is not entitled to attend the post-match press conference or any other media
activity held in the stadium.
2.
A player who is serving a match suspension:
a) may be allowed to sit in the stands, but not in the immediate vicinity of the field
of play, provided their security and integrity are safeguarded;
b) shall not enter the dressing room, tunnel or technical area, before or during the
match, attend the warm-up, or sit on the team bench. After the final whistle,
a suspended player may join their team in the dressing room;
c) is not entitled to attend the post-match press conference or any other media
activity held in the stadium.
3.
An official who has been sent off or is serving a match suspension:
a) may be allowed to sit in the stands, but not in the immediate vicinity of the field
of play, provided their security and integrity are safeguarded;
b) shall not enter the dressing room, tunnel or technical area, or communicate with
or contact any person involved in the match – in particular, players or technical
staff – by any means whatsoever prior to or during the match;
c) is not entitled to attend the post-match press conference or any other media
activity held in the stadium.
4.
A sending-off automatically incurs suspension from the subsequent match.
The FIFA judicial bodies may impose additional match suspensions and other
disciplinary measures.
5.
The automatic match suspension and any additional match suspension must
be served, even if the sending-off is imposed in a match that is later abandoned,
annulled, forfeited and/or replayed.
6.
If a match is abandoned, cancelled or forfeited (except for a violation of article 19),
a suspension is only considered to have been served if the team to which the
suspended player belongs is not responsible for the circumstances that led to
the abandonment, cancellation or forfeit of the match.
Special Procedures
IV.
51
7.
A match suspension is regarded as no longer pending if a match is retroactively
forfeited because a player took part in a match despite being ineligible. This also
applies to the match suspension imposed on the player who took part in the match
despite being ineligible.
67. CARRYING OVER CAUTIONS
1.
If a person receives a caution in two separate matches of the same FIFA
competition, they are automatically suspended from the next match in that
competition. Such suspensions must be served before any other suspension.
The Disciplinary Committee may exceptionally depart from or amend this rule
before the start of a particular competition. Any such decision reached by the
Disciplinary Committee is final and binding.
2.
Cautions received during one competition are not carried over to another
competition.
3.
They are, however, carried over from one round to the next in the same competition.
The Disciplinary Committee may exceptionally depart from this rule before the
start of a particular competition. This provision is subject to article 68 of this
Code and to any derogating rules that FIFA may issue for a specific competition.
4.
If a person is sent off as a result of a direct red card, any other caution they have
previously received in the same match is upheld.
68. CANCELLATION OF CAUTIONS
1.
The Disciplinary Committee may, at its own discretion and on its own initiative
or upon the justified and reasonable request of a confederation, cancel cautions
that have not resulted in a sending-off or a suspension by means of a decision
not subject to appeal.
2.
When evaluating the cancellation of cautions, the Disciplinary Committee must
take into account, among other general principles, the impact on the integrity of
the competition, and the equal treatment between participants.
69. CARRYING OVER MATCH SUSPENSIONS
1.
As a general rule, every match suspension (of players and other persons) is carried
over from one round to the next in the same competition.
2.
Match suspensions imposed in terms of matches in relation to a sending-off issued
against a player outside of a competition (separate match[es]) or not served during
the competition for which they were intended (elimination or the last match in the
competition) are carried over as follows:
52
a) FIFA World Cup™ and FIFA Women’s World Cup™: carried over to the
representative team’s next official match;
b) competitions subject to an age limit: carried over to the representative team’s
next official match in the same age group. Where the suspension cannot be
served in the same age group, it shall be carried over to the next-highest
age category;
c) FIFA Club World Cup™: carried over to the club’s next official match;
d) Women’s Olympic Football Tournament: carried over to the representative
team’s next official match;
e) Men’s Olympic Football Tournament: for players who meet the age limit, carried
over to the representative team’s next official match in the same age group.
Where the suspension cannot be served in the same age group, it shall be
carried over to the next-highest age category. For players who do not meet the
age limit, it shall be carried over to the representative team’s next official match;
f) confederation competitions for representative teams: carried over to the
representative team’s next official match;
g) competitions in which teams have been chosen in accordance with certain
criteria (cultural, geographical, historical, etc.): unless the regulations of these
competitions specifically stipulate otherwise, the suspension is carried over to
the representative team’s next official match;
h) friendly matches: carried over to the representative team’s next friendly match.
3.
If a representative team is hosting a final competition and is consequently not
required to participate in qualifying matches to reach the final competition of
this tournament and its next official match is in that final competition, any match
suspension shall be carried over to the representative team’s next friendly match.
4.
In no case may match suspensions resulting from several cautions issued to a
player in different matches of the same competition be carried over to another
competition.
5.
Officials of a club or an association shall serve a match suspension with any club
or association of which the official is an official.
6.
Match suspensions that have to be carried over to another competition must be
served by the person concerned, regardless of whether the status of that person
has changed in the meantime, including from player to official or vice versa.
Special Procedures
IV.
53
70. EXTENDING SANCTIONS TO HAVE WORLDWIDE
EFFECT
1.
If the infringement is serious, in particular but not limited to discrimination,
manipu­lation of football matches and competitions, misconduct against match
officials, or forgery and falsification, as well as sexual abuse or harassment,
the member associations, confederations, and other organising sports bodies shall
request that the Disciplinary Committee extend the sanctions they have imposed
so as to have worldwide effect (worldwide extension).
2.
Any doping-related legally binding sanction imposed by another national or
international sports association, national anti-doping organisation or any other
state body that complies with fundamental legal principles shall automatically be
adopted by FIFA and, provided that the requirements described hereunder and
in article 74 of the FIFA Anti-Doping Regulations are met, shall be automatically
recognised by all confederations and member associations.
3.
The request shall be submitted in writing via the FIFA Legal Portal and enclose
the following:
a) a true copy of the decision;
b) the name, email address, nationality and date of birth of the person who has
been sanctioned, or the name, postal address and email address of the club
that has been sanctioned;
c) the name of the association concerned;
d) the start and end date of the sanction which is to be submitted for a worldwide
extension;
e) evidence that the party concerned has been cited properly and has had the
opportunity to state its case (with the exception of provisional measures);
f) evidence that the decision has been duly communicated to the party
concerned; and
g) evidence that the party concerned has been informed that the sanction will
be submitted for a worldwide extension.
4.
If the Disciplinary Committee discovers that member associations, confederations
and other sports organisations have not requested a decision to be extended to
have worldwide effect, a decision may still be passed ex officio.
5.
A worldwide extension will be approved if the request fulfils the requirements set
forth in paragraph 3 above, the decision is compatible with the regulations of FIFA
and extending the sanction does not conflict with public order or with accepted
standards of behaviour.
54
6.
The chairperson of the Disciplinary Committee takes their decision, in principle,
without deliberations or orally hearing any of the parties, using only the file.
7.
The chairperson may exceptionally decide to summon the parties concerned.
8.
The chairperson is restricted to ascertaining that the conditions of this article have
been fulfilled. They may not review the substance of the decision.
9.
The chairperson shall either grant or refuse to grant the request to have the
sanction extended.
10.
A sanction imposed by an association or a confederation has the same effect in
each association of FIFA, in each confederation and in FIFA itself as if the sanction
had been imposed by any one of them.
11.
If a decision that is not yet final in a legal sense is extended to have worldwide effect,
any decision regarding extension shall follow the outcome of the association’s or
confederation’s current decision.
71. REVIEW
1.
A review may be requested before the competent judicial body after a legally
binding decision has been passed if a party discovers facts or proof that would
have resulted in a more favourable decision and that, even with due diligence,
could not have been produced sooner.
2.
A request for review shall be made within ten days of discovering the reasons
for review.
3.
The limitation period for submitting a request for review is one year after the
decision has become final and binding.

the first match of the final competition at the latest.
75. MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS’ DISCIPLINARY CODES

to the general principles of this Code for the purpose of harmonising disciplinary
measures. Article 15 and article 66 paragraph 4 of this Code are considered
mandatory in domestic competitions.

ANNEXE 1: LIST OF DISCIPLINARY MEASURES
Article 6 of this Code establishes the list of disciplinary measures which may be imposed
by FIFA’s judicial bodies on natural and legal persons.
This annexe is aimed at providing a list of specific disciplinary measures which may be
taken into consideration by the relevant judicial body when deciding on a specific case.
For the sake of good order, it is to be noted that the list of disciplinary measures
developed in the present annexe is not exhaustive, nor binding, and is without prejudice
to the general principles established under article 25 of this Code. As a matter of fact,
the decisions are rendered on a case-by-case basis and the type and extent of the
disciplinary measures are determined by the relevant judicial body in accordance with the
objective and subjective elements of the offence, taking into account both aggravating
and mitigating circumstances.
